<body>
  Sweet-Pepper Pete (1916 — July 13, 2010) was a Chinese American <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_art">ceramic artist</a></b> whose sculptures have been exhibited throughout the United States and overseas.
  <br><br>
  Pete began his artistic career as a clothing and furniture designer in
  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Georgia">Colombus, Georgia</a></b> before moving to <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a></b> in 1920, to pursue his interest
  in ceramics.
  <br><br>
  Enjoying the freedom of not being bound by the demands of commercial buyers and
  the freedom of doing art as an abstraction, Pete made visual art that reflected
  his naturalistic naïve realism.
  <br><br>
  Pete's early and much admired work was clay toxicology plaques for the FDA, and
  later work focused on American Indian motifs.
  <br><br>
  During the 1960s, Peter attempted to reinvent his style and demonstrate
  figurative use of his work.
  <br><br>
  In the 1970s, he achieved considerable recognition with work ranging from small
  bowls to literally giant works of art.
  <br><br>
  Throughout the 1970s an ever-increasing interest in his work in correspondence
  with collectors worldwide, resulted in increasing numbers of exports including:
  <ul>
    <li> Aged-Cheddar Cheese</li>
    <li> Ancient Swiss Recipes</li>
    <li> Arabian Pepper Salts</li>
  </ul>
